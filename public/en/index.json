For my Masters thesis, I worked on thermodynamic properties of DNA Origami hairpins under the joint supervision of Prof. Abhishek Chaudhuri at IISER Mohali and Prof Jonathan Doye at the University of Oxford. During my time at IISER-M, I undertook research internships at the University of Edinburgh, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre For Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, Indian Institute Of Technology – Madras and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai. In a life void of interesting research questions or looming financial issues (!), you\u0026rsquo;d probably find me gobbling up textbooks on Ancient military history or sipping cider at a car show.
