I'm a DPhil candidate at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) working on Free Energy Calculations for Drug Design in collaboration with [Vertex Pharmaceuticals](https://www.vrtx.com/home/). A Physicist by training and currently based at the [Biggin lab](https://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/biggin.php/) in the Department of Biochemistry, my research experience spans Structural Biophysics, Immunogenomics and Computational Chemistry. 

I'm interested in all things computational biomedical research and am particularly curious about the exciting world of biotech entrepreneurship. Starting November 2024, I will be pursuing my internship with [Roche AG](https://www.roche.com/), Zurich on AI-agentic workflows for target discovery.

Information About me:

- I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Science_Education_and_Research,_Mohali) in May 2022 with a Masters in Physics and Data Science. For my Masters thesis, I worked on thermodynamic properties of DNA Origami hairpins under the joint supervision of Prof. Abhishek Chaudhuri at IISER Mohali and [Prof Jonathan Doye](http://doye.chem.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.
- During my time at IISER-M, I undertook research internships at the University of Edinburgh, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre For Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, Indian Institute Of Technology ‚Äì Madras and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.

In a world void of interesting research questions or looming global risks (!), you'd probably find me gobbling up textbooks on Ancient military history or sipping cider at a car show. I still try to do this whenever I get some time off.
